Amazon inventory management
===========================
I choose Amazon because it is the largest e-commerce platform.

What I learned from their inventory management:

1.Avoid excess inventory: having enough stock to ship out customer orders is a good thing; however, having too much inventory can hurt your business.  Excess inventory costs money. You may be unable to respond quickly to shifts in customer demand, while aging inventory could force you to liquidate.
Amazon considers a product to have excess inventory if it has:

- Over 90 days of supply
- At least 1 unit aged over 90 days
- A better ROI (Return on investment) opportunity, such as reducing the price to increase sales.


2. Prevent low stock levels:  it’s important to have enough units to meet demand. Low stock levels can hurt your sales and brand. No one likes to order an item only to find it’s out of stock. The right inventory level for the business may depend on seasonality, sales history, or customer demands. a demand planning analysis has to be run to find the optimum inventory level.

3. Keep away from stranded or dead stock: Stranded inventory is sellable inventory but it isn’t listed for sale on the site. It hurts the business because it ties up your cash. You paid for the products, you are paying for storage, yet customers can't buy it.

4. Preventing spoilage: Some items like food products, supplements, or cosmetics have a sell-by or expiration date. When you hold inventory past its sell-by date, your investments go down the drain.  Tracking your items through a system can help you avoid spoilage, allowing you to run promotions or discounts on items at risk of spoiling in the near future.

5. Build and maintain good relationships with suppliers: Paying bills on time, Treating suppliers with respect, Offering constructive feedback, ..etc.

6. Monitor sell-through rate

7. Restock popular products quickly

8. Run promotions/discounts to reduce aging inventory: When products haven’t sold in over 90 days, you can take action to avoid aging stock.

9. Maintain four weeks of inventory cover
