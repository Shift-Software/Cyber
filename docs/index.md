Item Master
=============

The Lite Store Management (LSM) will be the first product that will be developed with Shift Software's framework (the framework isn't ready, but the development process has started). LSM will also be the first product that Shift Software will sell (usually the company does not sell products, instead services are provided to the clients)

In future, LSM will be a tool for the eCommerce platform, customers who use LSM will automatically be enrolled in the eCommerce platform, and the available products in the LSM will be listed online as well. The eCommerce platform isn't ready yet, in 2021 there were attempts to build a version but then it was abandoned, now Shift Software has the opportunity to resume working on another version with eBazar or other potential clients.

The dummy data can be found in this datasheet:
